[Krasovskii Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics](http://www.imm.uran.ru/eng) and [Ural Federal University](http://urfu.ru/en/) are jointly organizing the 3rd Ural Workshop on Parallel, Distributed, and Cloud Computing for Young Scientists (Ural-PDC 2017). The aim of the workshop is to build the community of young researchers who work on modern problems in parallel, distributed, cloud computing and to provide an academic forum that fosters them to share their ideas and results.

The Ural-PDC 2017 workshop was held on October 19, 2017 at the Ural Federal University ([4 Turgeneva Str.](https://2gis.ru/ekaterinburg/firm/1267620943605143), Yekaterinburg, Russia), room 507. We received 25 submissions, each of which has been reviewed by at least two program committee members. The committee decided to accept 14 papers. The workshop was attended by more than 20 people from 5 cities.

See you next year!
