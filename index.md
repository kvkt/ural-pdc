[Krasovskii Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics](http://www.imm.uran.ru/eng) and [Ural Federal University](https://urfu.ru/en/) are jointly organizing the 4th Ural Workshop on Parallel, Distributed, and Cloud Computing for Young Scientists (Ural-PDC 2018). The aim of the workshop is to build the community of young researchers who work on modern problems in parallel, distributed, cloud computing and to provide an academic forum that fosters them to share their ideas and results.

The Ural-PDC 2018 workshop was held on November 15, 2018 at the Conference hall of the Krasovskii Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics (3<sup>rd</sup> floor, [16 Sofia Kovalevskaya Str.](https://2gis.ru/ekaterinburg/firm/1267165676521629), Yekaterinburg, Russia). We received 20 submissions, each of which has been reviewed by at least two program committee members. The committee decided to accept 14 papers and an invited paper. The workshop was attended by more than 20 people from 6 cities.
